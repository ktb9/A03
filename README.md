Task: Create Repository

Feature:  added workflow for using github

Fix:  changed readme.md for definition of terms

**Branch**: The branch into which changes are combined when you merge a pull request. When you create a pull request, you can change the base branch from the repository's default branch to another branch if required.

**Clone**: A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy.

**Commit**: A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). 

**Fetch**: When you use git fetch, you're adding changes from the remote repository to your local working branch without committing them.

**GIT**: Is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows

**Github**: Is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git.

**Merge**: Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another.

**Merge Conflict**: A difference that occurs between merged branches. Merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file. 

**Push**: To push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com. For instance, if you change something locally, you can push those changes so that others may access them.

**Pull**: Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date. See also fetch.

**Remote**: This is the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com. Remote versions can be connected to local clones so that changes can be synced.

**Repository**: A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
